# OmniAuth LDAP

## Changes in this fork
This fork is for compatibility with JSON-encoded POST bodies instead of form-encoded.

Set header `Content-Type` to `application/json`

Send your credentials similar to below to use this gem:
`{"username":"USERNAME","password":"PASSWORD"}`

## LDAP

Use the LDAP strategy as a middleware in your application:

    use OmniAuth::Strategies::LDAP, 
        :title => "My LDAP", 
        :host => '10.101.10.1',
        :port => 389,
        :method => :plain,
        :base => 'dc=intridea, dc=com',
        :uid => 'sAMAccountName',
        :name_proc => Proc.new {|name| name.gsub(/@.*$/,'')},
        :bind_dn => 'default_bind_dn',
        # Or, alternatively:
        #:filter => '(&(uid=%{username})(memberOf=cn=myapp-users,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com))'
        :name_proc => Proc.new {|name| name.gsub(/@.*$/,'')}
        :bind_dn => 'default_bind_dn'
        :password => 'password'

All of the listed options are required, with the exception of `:title`, `:name_proc`, `:bind_dn`, and `:password`.
Allowed values of `:method` are: `:plain`, `:ssl`, `:tls`.

`:bind_dn` and `:password` is the default credentials to perform user lookup.
  most LDAP servers require that you supply a complete DN as a binding-credential, along with an authenticator
  such as a password. But for many applications, you often donâ€™t have a full DN to identify the user. 
  You usually get a simple identifier like a username or an email address, along with a password. 
  Since many LDAP servers don't allow anonymous access, search function will require a bound connection, 
  :bind_dn and :password will be required for searching on the username or email to retrieve the DN attribute 
  for the user. If the LDAP server allows anonymous access, you don't need to provide these two parameters.

`:uid` is the LDAP attribute name for the user name in the login form. 
  typically AD would be `'sAMAccountName'` or `'UserPrincipalName'`, while OpenLDAP is `'uid'`.

`:filter` is the LDAP filter used to search the user entry. It can be used in place of `:uid` for more flexibility.
  `%{username}` will be replaced by the user name processed by `:name_proc`.

`:name_proc` allows you to match the user name entered with the format of the `:uid` attributes. 
  For example, value of `'sAMAccountName'` in AD contains only the windows user name. If your user prefers using 
  email to login, a name_proc as above will trim the email string down to just the windows login name. 
  In summary, use `:name_proc` to fill the gap between the submitted username and LDAP uid attribute value.
 
`:try_sasl` and `:sasl_mechanisms` are optional. `:try_sasl [true | false], :sasl_mechanisms ['DIGEST-MD5' | 'GSS-SPNEGO']`
  Use them to initialize a SASL connection to server. If you are not familiar with these authentication methods, 
  please just avoid them.

Direct users to '/auth/ldap' to have them authenticated via your company's LDAP server.
