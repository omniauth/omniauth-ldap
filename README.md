## 🌻 Synopsis

Use the LDAP strategy as a middleware in your application:

```ruby
use OmniAuth::Strategies::LDAP,
  title: "My LDAP",
  host: "10.101.10.1",
  port: 389,
  method: :plain,
  base: "dc=intridea,dc=com",
  uid: "sAMAccountName",
  name_proc: proc { |name| name.gsub(/@.*$/, "") },
  bind_dn: "default_bind_dn",
  password: "password"
# Or, alternatively:
# use OmniAuth::Strategies::LDAP, filter: '(&(uid=%{username})(memberOf=cn=myapp-users,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com))'
```

All of the listed options are required, with the exception of `:title`, `:name_proc`, `:bind_dn`, and `:password`.

### Ruby 3.4

nkf/kconv has been part of Ruby since long ago.
Eventually it became a standard gem, but was changed to a bundled gem in Ruby 3.4.
In general, kconv and iconv have been superseded since Ruby 1.9 by the built-in
encoding support provided by String#encode, String#force_encoding, and similar methods.
But this gem has not yet been updated to remove its dependency on nkf/kconv.

As a result of all this you should add `nkf` to your Gemfile if you are using Ruby 3.4 or later.

```ruby
gem "nkf", "~> 0.1"
```

## ✨ Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```console
bundle add omniauth-ldap
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```console
gem install omniauth-ldap
```

### 🔒 Secure Installation

<details>
  <summary>For Medium or High Security Installations</summary>

This gem is cryptographically signed, and has verifiable [SHA-256 and SHA-512][💎SHA_checksums] checksums by
[stone_checksums][💎stone_checksums]. Be sure the gem you install hasn’t been tampered with
by following the instructions below.

Add my public key (if you haven’t already, expires 2045-04-29) as a trusted certificate:

```console
gem cert --add <(curl -Ls https://raw.github.com/galtzo-floss/certs/main/pboling.pem)
```

You only need to do that once.  Then proceed to install with:

```console
gem install omniauth-ldap -P HighSecurity
```

The `HighSecurity` trust profile will verify signed gems, and not allow the installation of unsigned dependencies.

If you want to up your security game full-time:

```console
bundle config set --global trust-policy MediumSecurity
```

`MediumSecurity` instead of `HighSecurity` is necessary if not all the gems you use are signed.

NOTE: Be prepared to track down certs for signed gems and add them the same way you added mine.

</details>

## ⚙️ Configuration

The following options are available for configuring the OmniAuth LDAP strategy:

### Required Options

- `:host` - The hostname or IP address of the LDAP server.
- `:port` - The port number of the LDAP server (default: 389).
- `:method` - The connection method. Allowed values: `:plain`, `:ssl`, `:tls` (default: `:plain`).
- `:base` - The base DN for the LDAP search.
- `:uid` or `:filter` - Either `:uid` (the LDAP attribute for username, default: "sAMAccountName") or `:filter` (LDAP filter for searching user entries). If `:filter` is provided, `:uid` is not required.

### Optional Options

- `:title` - The title for the authentication form (default: "LDAP Authentication").
- `:bind_dn` - The DN to bind with for searching users (required if anonymous access is not allowed).
- `:password` - The password for the bind DN.
- `:name_proc` - A proc to process the username before using it in the search (default: identity proc that returns the username unchanged).
- `:try_sasl` - Whether to use SASL authentication (default: false).
- `:sasl_mechanisms` - Array of SASL mechanisms to use (e.g., ["DIGEST-MD5", "GSS-SPNEGO"]).
- `:allow_anonymous` - Whether to allow anonymous binding (default: false).
- `:logger` - A logger instance for debugging (optional, for internal use).

## 🔧 Basic Usage

The strategy exposes a simple Rack middleware and can be used in plain Rack apps, Sinatra, or Rails.
Direct users to `/auth/ldap` to start authentication and handle the callback at `/auth/ldap/callback`.

Below are several concrete examples to get you started.

### Minimal Rack setup

```ruby
# config.ru
require "rack"
require "omniauth-ldap"

use Rack::Session::Cookie, secret: "change_me"
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :ldap,
    host: "ldap.example.com",
    port: 389,
    method: :plain,
    base: "dc=example,dc=com",
    uid: "uid",
    title: "Example LDAP"
end

run lambda { |env| [404, {"Content-Type" => "text/plain"}, [env.key?("omniauth.auth").to_s]] }
```

Visit `GET /auth/ldap` to initiate authentication (the middleware will render a login form unless you POST to `/auth/ldap`).

### Sinatra example

```ruby
require "sinatra"
require "omniauth-ldap"

use Rack::Session::Cookie, secret: "change_me"
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :ldap,
    title: "Company LDAP",
    host: "ldap.company.internal",
    base: "dc=company,dc=local",
    uid: "sAMAccountName",
    name_proc: proc { |username| username.gsub(/@.*$/, "") }
end

get "/" do
  '<a href="/auth/ldap">Sign in with LDAP</a>'
end

get "/auth/ldap/callback" do
  auth = request.env["omniauth.auth"]
  "Hello, #{auth.info["name"]}"
end
```

### Rails (initializer) example

Create `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use(OmniAuth::Builder) do
  provider :ldap,
    title: "Acme LDAP",
    host: "ldap.acme.internal",
    port: 389,
    base: "dc=acme,dc=corp",
    uid: "uid",
    bind_dn: "cn=search,dc=acme,dc=corp",
    password: ENV["LDAP_SEARCH_PASSWORD"],
    name_proc: proc { |n| n.split("@").first }
end
```

Then link users to `/auth/ldap` in your app (for example, in a Devise sign-in page).

### Using a custom filter

If you need to restrict authentication to a group or use a more complex lookup, pass `:filter`. Use `%{username}` — it will be replaced with the processed username (after `:name_proc`).

```ruby
provider :ldap,
  host: "ldap.example.com",
  base: "dc=example,dc=com",
  filter: "(&(uid=%{username})(memberOf=cn=myapp-users,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com))",
  bind_dn: "cn=search,dc=example,dc=com",
  password: ENV["LDAP_SEARCH_PASSWORD"]
```

### SASL (advanced)

SASL enables alternative bind mechanisms. Only enable if you understand the server-side requirements.

```ruby
provider :ldap,
  host: "ldap.example.com",
  base: "dc=example,dc=com",
  try_sasl: true,
  sasl_mechanisms: ["DIGEST-MD5"],
  uid: "uid"
```

Supported mechanisms include `"DIGEST-MD5"` and `"GSS-SPNEGO"` depending on your environment and gems.

### Name processing and examples

If users log in with an email but LDAP expects a short username, use `:name_proc` to normalize the submitted value:

```ruby
provider :ldap,
  host: "ldap.example.com",
  base: "dc=example,dc=com",
  uid: "sAMAccountName",
  name_proc: proc { |name| name.gsub(/@.*$/, "") }
```

This trims `alice@example.com` to `alice` before searching.

## 🦷 FLOSS Funding

While these tools are free software and will always be, the project would benefit immensely from some funding.
Raising a monthly budget of... "dollars" would make the project more sustainable.

We welcome both individual and corporate sponsors! We also offer a
wide array of funding channels to account for your preferences.
Currently, [GitHub Sponsors][🖇sponsor], and [Liberapay][⛳liberapay] are our preferred funding platforms.

**If you're working in a company that's making significant use of omniauth tools we'd
appreciate it if you suggest to your company to become a omniauth sponsor.**

You can support me in development of OmniAuth tools via

### Another way to support open-source

I’m driven by a passion to foster a thriving open-source community – a space where people can tackle complex problems, no matter how small.  Revitalizing libraries that have fallen into disrepair, and building new libraries focused on solving real-world challenges, are my passions.  I was recently affected by layoffs, and the tech jobs market is unwelcoming. I’m reaching out here because your support would significantly aid my efforts to provide for my family, and my farm (11 🐔 chickens, 2 🐶 dogs, 3 🐰 rabbits, 8 🐈‍ cats).

If you work at a company that uses my work, please encourage them to support me as a corporate sponsor. My work on gems you use might show up in `bundle fund`.

I’m developing a new library, [floss_funding][🖇floss-funding-gem], designed to empower open-source developers like myself to get paid for the work we do, in a sustainable way. Please give it a look.

**[Floss-Funding.dev][🖇floss-funding.dev]: 👉️ No network calls. 👉️ No tracking. 👉️ No oversight. 👉️ Minimal crypto hashing. 💡 Easily disabled nags**

## 📌 Versioning

This Library adheres to [![Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][📌semver-img]][📌semver].
Violations of this scheme should be reported as bugs.
Specifically, if a minor or patch version is released that breaks backward compatibility,
a new version should be immediately released that restores compatibility.
Breaking changes to the public API will only be introduced with new major versions.

> dropping support for a platform is both obviously and objectively a breaking change <br/>
>—Jordan Harband ([@ljharb](https://github.com/ljharb), maintainer of SemVer) [in SemVer issue 716][📌semver-breaking]

I understand that policy doesn't work universally ("exceptions to every rule!"),
but it is the policy here.
As such, in many cases it is good to specify a dependency on this library using
the [Pessimistic Version Constraint][📌pvc] with two digits of precision.

For example:

```ruby
spec.add_dependency("omniauth-ldap", "~> 1.0")
```

<details>
<summary>📌 Is "Platform Support" part of the public API? More details inside.</summary>

SemVer should, IMO, but doesn't explicitly, say that dropping support for specific Platforms
is a *breaking change* to an API.
It is obvious to many, but not all, and since the spec is silent, the bike shedding is endless.

To get a better understanding of how SemVer is intended to work over a project's lifetime,
read this article from the creator of SemVer:

## 🤑 A request for help

Maintainers have teeth and need to pay their dentists.
After getting laid off in an RIF in March, and encountering difficulty finding a new one,
I began spending most of my time building open source tools.
I'm hoping to be able to pay for my kids' health insurance this month,
so if you value the work I am doing, I need your support.
Please consider sponsoring me or the project.
