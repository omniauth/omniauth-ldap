    <summary>👣 How will this project approach the September 2025 hostile takeover of RubyGems? 🚑️</summary>

I've summarized my thoughts in [this blog post](https://dev.to/galtzo/hostile-takeover-of-rubygems-my-thoughts-5hlo).

</details>

## 🌻 Synopsis

Use the LDAP strategy as a middleware in your application:

```ruby
use OmniAuth::Strategies::LDAP,
  title: "My LDAP",
  host: "10.101.10.1",
  port: 389,
  encryption: :plain,
  base: "dc=intridea,dc=com",
  uid: "sAMAccountName",
  name_proc: proc { |name| name.gsub(/@.*$/, "") },
  bind_dn: "default_bind_dn",
  password: "password",
  # Optional timeouts (seconds)
  connect_timeout: 3,
  read_timeout: 7,
  tls_options: {
    ssl_version: "TLSv1_2",
    ciphers: ["AES-128-CBC", "AES-128-CBC-HMAC-SHA1", "AES-128-CBC-HMAC-SHA256"],
  },
  mapping: {
    "name" => "cn;lang-en",
    "email" => ["preferredEmail", "mail"],
    "nickname" => ["uid", "userid", "sAMAccountName"],
  }
# Or, alternatively:
# use OmniAuth::Strategies::LDAP, filter: '(&(uid=%{username})(memberOf=cn=myapp-users,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com))'
```

At minimum you normally configure `:host`, `:base`, and either `:uid` or `:filter`. The other options shown above customize connection behavior, TLS, username normalization, timeouts, and returned auth info.

For trusted header SSO, enable `header_auth: true` and explicitly choose the trusted identity source with `header_auth_source: :env` or `header_auth_source: :http_header`. See [Trusted header SSO](#trusted-header-sso-remote_user-and-friends) for the security requirements.

### TLS certificate verification

This gem enables TLS certificate verification by default when you use `encryption: "ssl"` (LDAPS / simple TLS) or `encryption: "tls"` (STARTTLS). We always pass `tls_options` to Net::LDAP based on `OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext::DEFAULT_PARAMS`, which includes `verify_mode: OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER` and sane defaults.

- Secure by default: you do not need to set anything extra to verify the LDAP server certificate.
- To customize trust or ciphers, supply your own `tls_options`, which are merged over the safe defaults.
- If you truly need to skip verification (not recommended), set `disable_verify_certificates: true`.

Examples:

```ruby
# Verify server certs (default behavior)
use OmniAuth::Strategies::LDAP,
  host: ENV["LDAP_HOST"],
  port: 636,
  encryption: "ssl",  # or "tls"
  base: "dc=example,dc=com",
  uid:  "uid"

# Use a private CA bundle and restrict protocol/ciphers
use OmniAuth::Strategies::LDAP,
  host: ENV["LDAP_HOST"],
  port: 636,
  encryption: "ssl",
  base: "dc=example,dc=com",
  uid:  "uid",
  tls_options: {
    ca_file: "/etc/ssl/private/my_org_ca.pem",
    ssl_version: "TLSv1_2",
    ciphers: ["TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384", "TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256"],
  }

# Opt out of verification (NOT recommended – use only in trusted test/dev scenarios)
use OmniAuth::Strategies::LDAP,
  host: ENV["LDAP_HOST"],
  port: 636,
  encryption: "ssl",
  base: "dc=example,dc=com",
  uid:  "uid",
  disable_verify_certificates: true
```

Note: Net::LDAP historically defaulted to no certificate validation when `tls_options` were not provided. This library mitigates that by always providing secure `tls_options` unless you explicitly disable verification.

## ✨ Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```console
bundle add omniauth-ldap
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```console
gem install omniauth-ldap
```

### 🔒 Secure Installation

<details markdown="1">
  <summary>For Medium or High Security Installations</summary>

This gem is cryptographically signed, and has verifiable [SHA-256 and SHA-512][💎SHA_checksums] checksums by
[stone_checksums][💎stone_checksums]. Be sure the gem you install hasn’t been tampered with
by following the instructions below.

Add my public key (if you haven’t already, expires 2045-04-29) as a trusted certificate:

```console
gem cert --add <(curl -Ls https://raw.github.com/galtzo-floss/certs/main/pboling.pem)
```

You only need to do that once.  Then proceed to install with:

```console
gem install omniauth-ldap -P HighSecurity
```

The `HighSecurity` trust profile will verify signed gems, and not allow the installation of unsigned dependencies.

If you want to up your security game full-time:

```console
bundle config set --global trust-policy MediumSecurity
```

`MediumSecurity` instead of `HighSecurity` is necessary if not all the gems you use are signed.

NOTE: Be prepared to track down certs for signed gems and add them the same way you added mine.

</details>

## ⚙️ Configuration

The following options are available for configuring the OmniAuth LDAP strategy:

### Required Options

- `:host` - The hostname or IP address of the LDAP server.
- `:base` - The base DN for the LDAP search.
- `:uid` or `:filter` - Either `:uid` (the LDAP attribute for username, default: "sAMAccountName") or `:filter` (LDAP filter for searching user entries). If `:filter` is provided, `:uid` is not required. Note: This `:uid` option is the search attribute, not the top-level `auth.uid` in the OmniAuth result.

### Optional Options

- `:title` - The title for the authentication form (default: "LDAP Authentication").
- `:port` - The port number of the LDAP server (default: 389).
- `:encryption` - The connection method. Allowed values: `:plain`, `:ssl`, `:tls` (default: `:plain`). `:method` is still accepted for compatibility, but is deprecated.
- `:bind_dn` - The DN to bind with for searching users (required if anonymous access is not allowed).
- `:password` - The password for the bind DN.
- `:name_proc` - A proc to process the username before using it in the search (default: identity proc that returns the username unchanged).
- `:try_sasl` - Whether to use SASL authentication (default: false).
- `:sasl_mechanisms` - Array of SASL mechanisms to use (e.g., ["DIGEST-MD5", "GSS-SPNEGO"]).
- `:allow_anonymous` - Whether to allow anonymous binding (default: false).
- `:logger` - A logger instance for debugging (optional, for internal use).
- `:password_policy` - When true, the strategy will request the LDAP Password Policy response control (OID `1.3.6.1.4.1.42.2.27.8.5.1`) during the user bind. If the server supports it, the adaptor exposes:
  - `adaptor.last_operation_result` — the last Net::LDAP operation result object.
  - `adaptor.last_password_policy_response` — the matching password policy response control (implementation-specific object). This can indicate conditions such as password expired, account locked, reset required, or grace logins remaining (per the draft RFC).
- `:connect_timeout` - Maximum time in seconds to wait when establishing the TCP connection to the LDAP server. Forwarded to `Net::LDAP`.
- `:read_timeout` - Maximum time in seconds to wait for reads during LDAP operations (search/bind). Forwarded to `Net::LDAP`.
- `:mapping` - Customize how LDAP attributes map to the returned `auth.info` hash. A sensible default mapping is built into the strategy and will be merged with your overrides. See `lib/omniauth/strategies/ldap.rb` for the default keys and behavior; values can be a String (single attribute), an Array (first present attribute wins), or a Hash (string pattern with placeholders like `%0` combined from multiple attributes).
- `:header_auth` - Enable trusted upstream identity SSO (default: false). When enabled, the strategy trusts the configured header/env key, performs an LDAP lookup, and skips the user password bind.
- `:header_name` - Header/env key used for trusted header SSO (default: "REMOTE_USER").
- `:header_auth_source` - Trusted identity source for header SSO (default: `:env`). Use `:env` to read only `env["REMOTE_USER"]`-style server variables. Use `:http_header` to read only Rack `HTTP_` header keys such as `env["HTTP_REMOTE_USER"]`; only configure this behind a proxy that strips client-supplied copies.
- `:header_auth_require_tls` - Require TLS for trusted header SSO requests (default: true).

Example enabling password policy:

```ruby
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :ldap,
    host: "ldap.example.com",
    base: "dc=example,dc=com",
    uid: "uid",
    bind_dn: "cn=search,dc=example,dc=com",
    password: ENV["LDAP_SEARCH_PASSWORD"],
    password_policy: true
end
```

Note: This is best-effort and compatible with a range of net-ldap versions. If your server supports the control, you can inspect the response via the `adaptor` instance during/after authentication (for example in a failure handler) to tailor error messages.

### Auth Hash UID vs LDAP :uid (search attribute)

- By design, the top-level `auth.uid` returned by this strategy is the entry's Distinguished Name (DN).
- The configuration option `:uid` controls which LDAP attribute is used to locate the entry (or to build the filter), not the value exposed as `auth.uid`.
- Your LDAP "account name" (for example, `sAMAccountName` on Active Directory or `uid` on many schemas) is exposed via `auth.info.nickname` and is also available in `auth.extra.raw_info`.

Why DN for `auth.uid`?

- DN is the canonical, globally unique identifier for an LDAP entry and is always present in search results. See LDAPv3 and DN syntax: [RFC 4511][rfc4511] (LDAP protocol) and [RFC 4514][rfc4514] (String Representation of Distinguished Names).
- Attributes like `uid` (defined in [RFC 4519][rfc4519]) or `sAMAccountName` (Active Directory–specific) may be absent, duplicated across parts of the DIT, or vary between directories. Using DN ensures consistent behavior across AD, OpenLDAP, and other servers.
- This trade-off favors cross-directory interoperability and stability for apps that need a unique identifier.

Where to find the "username"-style value

- `auth.info.nickname` maps from the first present of: `uid`, `userid`, or `sAMAccountName`.
- You can also read the raw attribute from `auth.extra.raw_info` (a `Net::LDAP::Entry`):

```ruby
post "/auth/ldap/callback" do
  auth = request.env["omniauth.auth"]
  dn = auth.uid                                # => "cn=alice,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"
  username = auth.info.nickname                # => "alice" (from uid/sAMAccountName)
  # Or, directly from raw_info (case-insensitive keys):
  sams = auth.extra.raw_info[:samaccountname]
  sam = sams.first if sams
  # ...
end
```

If you need top-level `auth.uid` to be something other than the DN (for example, `sAMAccountName`), you'll currently need to read it from `auth.info.nickname` (or `raw_info`) in your app. Changing the top-level `uid` mapping would be a breaking behavior change for existing users; if you have a use-case, please open an issue to discuss a configurable mapping.

## 🔧 Basic Usage

The strategy exposes a simple Rack middleware and can be used in plain Rack apps, Sinatra, or Rails.
With OmniAuth 2.x, initiate authentication with `POST /auth/ldap`; `GET /auth/ldap` returns 404 by default. Older OmniAuth 1.x deployments may still render the form on `GET /auth/ldap`. Handle the callback at `/auth/ldap/callback`.

Below are several concrete examples to get you started.

### Minimal Rack setup

```ruby
# config.ru
require "rack"
require "omniauth-ldap"

use Rack::Session::Cookie, secret: "change_me"
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :ldap,
    host: "ldap.example.com",
    port: 389,
    encryption: :plain,
    base: "dc=example,dc=com",
    uid: "uid",
    title: "Example LDAP"
end

run lambda { |env| [404, {"Content-Type" => "text/plain"}, [env.key?("omniauth.auth").to_s]] }
```

Submit `POST /auth/ldap` to initiate authentication. With OmniAuth 2.x, the middleware renders the login form on POST when credentials are not already present; with OmniAuth 1.x, `GET /auth/ldap` can also render the form.

### Sinatra example

```ruby
require "sinatra"
require "omniauth-ldap"

use Rack::Session::Cookie, secret: "change_me"
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :ldap,
    title: "Company LDAP",
    host: "ldap.company.internal",
    base: "dc=company,dc=local",
    uid: "sAMAccountName",
    name_proc: proc { |username| username.gsub(/@.*$/, "") }
end

get "/" do
  '<form action="/auth/ldap" method="post"><button type="submit">Sign in with LDAP</button></form>'
end

post "/auth/ldap/callback" do
  auth = request.env["omniauth.auth"]
  "Hello, #{auth.info["name"]}"
end
```

### Rails (initializer) example

Create `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use(OmniAuth::Builder) do
  provider :ldap,
    title: "Acme LDAP",
    host: "ldap.acme.internal",
    port: 389,
    base: "dc=acme,dc=corp",
    uid: "uid",
    bind_dn: "cn=search,dc=acme,dc=corp",
    password: ENV["LDAP_SEARCH_PASSWORD"],
    name_proc: proc { |n| n.split("@").first }
end
```

Then submit users to `/auth/ldap` with POST in your app (for example, from a Devise sign-in page).

### Use JSON Body

This gem is compatible with JSON-encoded POST bodies as well as traditional form-encoded.

- Set header `Content-Type` to `application/json`.
- Send a JSON object containing `username` and `password`.
- Rails automatically exposes parsed JSON params via `env["action_dispatch.request.request_parameters"]`, which this strategy reads first. In non-Rails Rack apps, ensure you use a JSON parser middleware if you post raw JSON.

Examples

- curl (JSON):

  ```bash
  curl -i \
    -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"username":"alice","password":"secret"}' \
    http://localhost:3000/auth/ldap
  ```

  The request phase will redirect to `/auth/ldap/callback` when both fields are present.

- curl (form-encoded, still supported):

  ```bash
  curl -i \
    -X POST \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
    --data-urlencode 'username=alice' \
    --data-urlencode 'password=secret' \
    http://localhost:3000/auth/ldap
  ```

- Browser (JavaScript fetch):

  ```js
  fetch('/auth/ldap', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ username: 'alice', password: 'secret' })
  }).then(res => {
    if (res.redirected) {
      window.location = res.url; // typically /auth/ldap/callback
    }
  });
  ```

Notes

- You can still initiate authentication with a regular form POST and then submit credentials as form-encoded data. JSON is an additional option, not a replacement.
- In the callback phase (`POST /auth/ldap/callback`), the strategy reads JSON credentials the same way; Rails exposes them via `action_dispatch.request.request_parameters` and non-Rails apps should use a JSON parser middleware.

### Using a custom filter

If you need to restrict authentication to a group or use a more complex lookup, pass `:filter`. Use `%{username}` — it will be replaced with the processed username (after `:name_proc`).

```ruby
provider :ldap,
  host: "ldap.example.com",
  base: "dc=example,dc=com",
  filter: "(&(uid=%{username})(memberOf=cn=myapp-users,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com))",
  bind_dn: "cn=search,dc=example,dc=com",
  password: ENV["LDAP_SEARCH_PASSWORD"]
```

What `:filter` actually does

- If `:filter` is provided, the strategy constructs an LDAP filter string by substituting `%{username}` with the submitted username after applying `:name_proc`, escaping special characters per RFC 4515, and passes it to the directory search.
- In the normal password flow, a successful search returns the user's DN and we then bind as that DN with the submitted password.
- In trusted header SSO flow (`header_auth: true`), we only perform the search and skip the user password bind; if the search returns no entry, authentication fails.
- If `:filter` is not provided, the strategy falls back to a simple equality filter using `:uid` (e.g. `(uid=alice)`).

Notes on escaping and safety

- We escape the interpolated username with `Net::LDAP::Filter.escape`, which protects against LDAP injection and handles special characters like `(`, `)`, `*`, and `\`.
- Your static filter text is used as-is — keep it to a valid LDAP filter expression and only use `%{username}` for substitution.

Group-based recipes

- Active Directory (simple group):

  ```text
  (&(sAMAccountName=%{username})(memberOf=cn=myapp-users,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com))
  ```

- Active Directory (nested groups via matchingRuleInChain):

  ```text
  (&(sAMAccountName=%{username})(memberOf:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:=cn=myapp-users,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com))
  ```

- OpenLDAP (groupOfNames):

  ```text
  (&(uid=%{username})(memberOf=cn=myapp-users,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com))
  ```

  or, if you can't use `memberOf` overlays, filter on the group and member DN:

  ```text
  (&(uid=%{username})(|(uniqueMember=uid=%{username},ou=people,dc=example,dc=com)(member=uid=%{username},ou=people,dc=example,dc=com)))
  ```

Username normalization examples

- If your users sign in with an email but the directory expects a short name, combine `:name_proc` with `:filter`:

  ```ruby
  provider :ldap,
    name_proc: proc { |n| n.split("@").first },
    filter: "(&(sAMAccountName=%{username})(memberOf=cn=myapp-users,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com))"
    # other settings...
  ```

Discourse plugin (jonmbake/discourse-ldap-auth)

- That plugin forwards its `filter` setting to this gem. You can therefore paste the same filter strings shown above.
- Example (allow only members of `forum-users`):

  ```text
  (&(uid=%{username})(memberOf=cn=forum-users,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com))
  ```

- If users type an email address but your directory matches on a short user id, also configure `name_proc` accordingly in your app (or the plugin, if supported).

### SASL (advanced)

SASL enables alternative bind mechanisms. Only enable if you understand the server-side requirements.

```ruby
provider :ldap,
  host: "ldap.example.com",
  base: "dc=example,dc=com",
  try_sasl: true,
  sasl_mechanisms: ["DIGEST-MD5"],
  uid: "uid"
```

Supported mechanisms include "DIGEST-MD5" and "GSS-SPNEGO" depending on your environment and gems.

### Name processing and examples

If users log in with an email but LDAP expects a short username, use `:name_proc` to normalize the submitted value:

```ruby
provider :ldap,
  host: "ldap.example.com",
  base: "dc=example,dc=com",
  uid: "sAMAccountName",
  name_proc: proc { |name| name.gsub(/@.*$/, "") }
```

This trims `alice@example.com` to `alice` before searching.

### Mounted under a subdirectory (SCRIPT_NAME)

If your app is served from a path prefix (for example, behind a reverse proxy at `/myapp`, or mounted via Rack::URLMap, or Rails `relative_url_root`), the OmniAuth callback must include that subdirectory. This strategy uses `callback_url` for the form action and redirects, so it automatically includes any `SCRIPT_NAME` set by Rack/Rails. In other words, you typically do not need any special configuration beyond ensuring `SCRIPT_NAME` is correct in the request environment.

- Works out-of-the-box when:
  - You mount the app at a path using Rack’s `map`/`URLMap`.
  - You set Rails’ `config.relative_url_root` (or `RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT`) or deploy under a prefix with a reverse proxy that sets `SCRIPT_NAME`.

Rack example (mounted at /myapp):

```ruby
# config.ru
require "rack"
require "omniauth-ldap"

app = Rack::Builder.new do
  use(Rack::Session::Cookie, secret: "change_me")
  use(OmniAuth::Builder) do
    provider(
      :ldap,
      host: "ldap.example.com",
      base: "dc=example,dc=com",
      uid: "uid",
      title: "Example LDAP",
    )
  end

  run(->(env) { [404, {"Content-Type" => "text/plain"}, [env.key?("omniauth.auth").to_s]] })
end

run Rack::URLMap.new(
  "/myapp" => app,
)
```

- Visiting `POST /myapp/auth/ldap` renders the login form with `action='http://host/myapp/auth/ldap/callback'`.
- Any redirects (including header-based SSO fast path) will also point to `http://host/myapp/auth/ldap/callback`.

Rails example (relative_url_root):

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb (or an initializer)
Rails.application.configure do
  config.relative_url_root = "/myapp"  # or set ENV["RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT"]
end

# config/initializers/omniauth.rb
Rails.application.config.middleware.use(OmniAuth::Builder) do
  provider :ldap,
    title: "Acme LDAP",
    host: "ldap.acme.internal",
    base: "dc=acme,dc=corp",
    uid: "uid",
    bind_dn: "cn=search,dc=acme,dc=corp",
    password: ENV["LDAP_SEARCH_PASSWORD"],
    name_proc: proc { |n| n.split("@").first }
end
```

- With `relative_url_root` set, Rails/Rack provide `SCRIPT_NAME=/myapp`, and this strategy will issue a form with `action='.../myapp/auth/ldap/callback'` and redirect accordingly.

Behind proxies with unusual host/proto handling (optional):

OmniAuth usually derives the correct scheme/host/prefix from Rack (and standard `X-Forwarded-*` headers). If your environment produces incorrect absolute URLs, you can override the computed host and prefix by setting `OmniAuth.config.full_host`:

```ruby
OmniAuth.config.full_host = lambda do |env|
  scheme = (env["HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO"] || env["rack.url_scheme"]).to_s.split(",").first
  host = env["HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST"] || env["HTTP_HOST"] || [env["SERVER_NAME"], env["SERVER_PORT"]].compact.join(":")
  script = env["SCRIPT_NAME"].to_s
  "#{scheme}://#{host}#{script}"
end
```

Note: You generally do not need this override. Prefer configuring your proxy to pass standard `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host` headers and let Rack/OmniAuth compute the full URL.

- Header-based SSO (`header_auth: true`) also respects `SCRIPT_NAME`; when a trusted header is present on `POST /myapp/auth/ldap`, the strategy redirects to `http://host/myapp/auth/ldap/callback`.

### Trusted header SSO (REMOTE_USER and friends)

Some deployments terminate SSO at a reverse proxy or portal and forward the already-authenticated user identity via a server-set environment variable or HTTP header such as `REMOTE_USER`.
When you enable this mode, the LDAP strategy will trust the upstream header, perform a directory lookup for that user, and complete OmniAuth without asking the user for a password.

Important: Only enable this behind a trusted front-end that authenticates users before they can reach the OmniAuth endpoint. When `header_auth` is enabled the strategy logs a prominent security warning because it trusts the upstream identity completely.

Configuration options:

- `:header_auth` (Boolean, default: false) — Enable trusted header SSO.
- `:header_name` (String, default: "REMOTE_USER") — The env/header key to read.
- `:header_auth_source` (`:env` or `:http_header`, default: `:env`) — Which Rack env key form to trust.
  - `:env` reads only the exact server-set environment key, such as `env["REMOTE_USER"]`.
  - `:http_header` reads only the Rack HTTP header key, such as `env["HTTP_REMOTE_USER"]`. Only use this behind a proxy that strips client-sent copies of the header before setting its trusted value.
- `:header_auth_require_tls` (Boolean, default: true) — Raise an error if trusted header SSO is used on a non-TLS request.
- `:name_proc` is applied to the header value before search (e.g., to strip a domain part).
- Search is done using your configured `:uid` or `:filter` and the service bind (`:bind_dn`/`:password`) or anonymous bind if allowed.

Minimal Rack example:

```ruby
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :ldap,
    host: "ldap.example.com",
    base: "dc=example,dc=com",
    uid: "uid",
    bind_dn: "cn=search,dc=example,dc=com",
    password: ENV["LDAP_SEARCH_PASSWORD"],
    header_auth: true,                  # trust the configured upstream identity
    header_name: "REMOTE_USER",        # default
    header_auth_source: :env,           # default; reads env["REMOTE_USER"]
    name_proc: proc { |n| n.split("@").first }
end
```

Rails initializer example:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use(OmniAuth::Builder) do
  provider :ldap,
    title: "Acme LDAP",
    host: "ldap.acme.internal",
    base: "dc=acme,dc=corp",
    uid: "sAMAccountName",
    bind_dn: "cn=search,dc=acme,dc=corp",
    password: ENV["LDAP_SEARCH_PASSWORD"],
    header_auth: true,
    header_name: "REMOTE_USER",
    header_auth_source: :env,
    # Optionally restrict with a group filter while using the header value
    filter: "(&(sAMAccountName=%{username})(memberOf=cn=myapp-users,ou=groups,dc=acme,dc=corp))",
    name_proc: proc { |n| n.gsub(/@.*$/, "") }
end
```

Flow:

- If `header_auth` is on and the header is present when the request hits `/auth/ldap`, the strategy immediately redirects to `/auth/ldap/callback`.
- In the callback, the strategy searches the directory for that user and maps their attributes; no user password bind is attempted.
- If the header is missing (or `header_auth` is false), the normal username/password form flow is used.

Security checklist:

- Prefer `header_auth_source: :env` for server-set variables such as `REMOTE_USER`.
- Use `header_auth_source: :http_header` only when your reverse proxy strips user-controlled copies of the header and sets the canonical value itself.
- Keep `header_auth_require_tls` enabled unless a separate trusted channel protects traffic between the proxy and your app.
- Consider also restricting with a group-based `:filter` so only authorized users can sign in.

## 📌 Versioning

This Library adheres to [![Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][📌semver-img]][📌semver].
Violations of this scheme should be reported as bugs.
Specifically, if a minor or patch version is released that breaks backward compatibility,
a new version should be immediately released that restores compatibility.
Breaking changes to the public API will only be introduced with new major versions.

> dropping support for a platform is both obviously and objectively a breaking change <br/>
>—Jordan Harband ([@ljharb](https://github.com/ljharb), maintainer of SemVer) [in SemVer issue 716][📌semver-breaking]

I understand that policy doesn't work universally ("exceptions to every rule!"),
but it is the policy here.
As such, in many cases it is good to specify a dependency on this library using
the [Pessimistic Version Constraint][📌pvc] with two digits of precision.

For example:

```ruby
spec.add_dependency("omniauth-ldap", "~> 1.0")
```

<details markdown="1">
<summary>📌 Is "Platform Support" part of the public API? More details inside.</summary>

SemVer should, IMO, but doesn't explicitly, say that dropping support for specific Platforms
is a *breaking change* to an API, and for that reason the bike shedding is endless.

To get a better understanding of how SemVer is intended to work over a project's lifetime,
read this article from the creator of SemVer:
